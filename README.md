# Enterprise-DCOS-1.12-Install-Cheatsheet

This repository comprises my "cheatsheet" of steps to go from a "base Linux (Centos 7 or RHEL 7) to fully running DC/OS Cluster.

It is broken into three steps:

[1. Prerequisites:](https://github.com/jdyver/Enterprise-DC-OS-LATEST-Install-Cheatsheet/blob/master/1%20-%20Prerequisites.md) To be installed on all nodes including Boodstrap, Master, and Agents

[2. Bootstrap Preparation:](https://github.com/jdyver/Enterprise-DC-OS-LATEST-Install-Cheatsheet/blob/master/2%20-%20Bootstrap%20Preparation.md) Prepares the installation and configuration files on the Bootstrap node.

[3. Install:](https://github.com/jdyver/Enterprise-DC-OS-LATEST-Install-Cheatsheet/blob/master/3%20-%20Installation.md)  Deploys individual software to the nodes based on the cluster node type

FYI - Go to [github.com/dmennell](https://github.com/dmennell/Enterprise-DC-OS-1.12-Install-Cheatsheet) for 1.11 and 1.12 instructions.

These instructions are Dan's personal condensation of the Advanced Installer from the Enterprise DC/OS 1.12 documents and a few other of his personal best practices with updates from DC/OS 1.13 documentation.
